If it detects someone moving into a region\r\nthat you have defined, then your app will be started and the appropriate events\r\nwill be triggered.\r\n\r\nThese are the same API's that drive the 'reminders' app (i.e. \"Remind me to pay\r\nmy bills when I get home\")\r\n\r\nRegions are circular, and are defined as a latitude, longitude and radius size.\r\nAdditionally, you provide an id that's unique for your app.  These attributes\r\nwill also be passed to each relevant event listener.\r\n\r\n### What this is NOT\r\n\r\nThis will not help you if you want to do location monitoring or significant\r\nchange monitoring.  I could add that if someone needs it, but I don't right\r\nnow, so this module is region monitoring only.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Contributing\r\n\r\nIf you have improvements I'm happy to merge pull requests (if they include some\r\nsort of test plan).\r\n\r\n\r\nTesting\r\n-------\r\nThere aren't any real automated tests here since you sort of need to simulate\r\nmoving around to get events firing.  You can do this in the iPhone Simulator\r\n'Debug' menu item.\r\n\r\nCheck out  `example/app.js` for a complete example of how to integrate this\r\ninto your project.\r\n\r\n\r\nInstall\r\n-------\r\n\r\nUnzip the zip file included to your modules directory.  You can also build the\r\napp yourself if you want (but I've included the latest .zip in case you need\r\nit).\r\n\r\nRegister your module with your application by editing `tiapp.xml` and adding\r\nyour module.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n    <modules>\r\n      <module version=\"0.1\">com.foodonthetable.regions</module>\r\n    </modules>\r\n\r\nWhen you run your project, the compiler will know automatically compile in your module\r\ndependencies and copy appropriate image assets into the application.\r\n\r\n\r\nUsing Regions in Code\r\n---------------------\r\n\r\nI've tried to make this as simple as possible.\r\n\r\n    var regions = require('com.foodonthetable.regions');\r\n\r\n    regions.addEventListener(\"didEnterRegion\", function (event) {\r\n      Ti.API.info('didEnterRegion: ' + event.region.id + \" (\" + event.message + \")\");\r\n    });\r\n\r\n    regions.startMonitoring({\r\n      id:'test',\r\n      radius:100.0,\r\n      lat:30.2796,\r\n      lng:-97.7595\r\n    });\r\n\r\nCheck out `example/app.js` for a complete example of all available events.\r\n\r\n\r\nContact\r\n-------\r\n@shad on GitHub\r\n@shadr on Twitter","google":""}
